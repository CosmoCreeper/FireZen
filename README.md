<p align="center">The only Zen with DRM support.</p>

## About
FireZEN is a way to modify Firefox into Zen by bringing all the JavaScript that makes up Zen into Firefox, but leaving binaries alone.
By doing this, you're left with a very Zen-like experience and you get to keep your DRM.
While this may seem amazing, there is a very high chance you will encounter bugs and you may even lose your data.
For this reason, we do not recommend that you try this unless you know what you're doing, and we do not take liability for any problems that arise along the way.

## Installation
There is only one method of installation as of right now, manual.

**Prerequisites:** Zen and Firefox. Firefox must be the same version your Zen is built off of (the release notes will tell you).

1. **Copy Zen's primary files to Firefox:** Navigate to Zen's folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Zen Browser\`), copy the `browser` folder, the `xul.dll` file, and the `omni.ja` file. Then navigate to Firefox's folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\`) and paste it all. Make sure to overwrite the original files.
2. **Install Sine:** You now need to install [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine/). This is required to install a mod that fixes a couple of visual issues.
3. **Launch FireZEN:** You may now open Firefox. First, a welcome page will appear. If an inescapable dialog box appears, press enter.
4. **Install the FireZEN mod:** Navigate to the settings page, click on Sine, then inside of the input box for a repository, type `CosmoCreeper/FireZen`, then click `Install`, which will fix some visual issues with FireZEN.
5. **Disable auto-updating:** Auto-updating will break your setup, so we recommend disabling it.

And that is all for FireZEN! Thank you for giving it a try!🔥
